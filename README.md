# epitome

A janky webpage for Netrunner TOs to share leaderboards and match results/pairings. It reads the JSON part of a TOME export to generate the aforementioned leaderboard and results/pairings. *Warning: it is very much a kludge at the moment.*

Make sure to change the TOME export path in index.html to a URL on your favorite updatable text hosting service.
Each round, after you generate pairings in TOME, export the tournament and update with the new JSON.
