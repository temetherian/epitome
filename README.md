# epitome

A janky webpage for Netrunner TOs to share leaderboards and match results/pairings. It reads the JSON part of a TOME export, to generate the aforementioned leaderboard and results/pairings. *Warning: it is very much a kludge at the moment.*

Libraries not in this repo, but readily available: 

* breeze.js
* jQuery
* underscore

Also not in this repo, because I didn't write it:

* A bunch of JavaScript that was copied from TOME
* Some other JavaScript that was copied from TOME, then hit with a hammer until it fit in the round hole
